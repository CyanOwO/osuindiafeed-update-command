# osuindiafeed-update-command (for BathBot discord bot)

Python prerequisite modules: Selenium, BeautifulSoup4
<br> `pip install Selenium` <br> `pip install BeautifulSoup4`

then just run the python file and it will create an output.txt file in the same directory.

Please use the <untrackall command before adding the lines from output.txt (The bot only accepts 10 usernames at once so they are already split like that)

Example of output.txt:
```
<track "tin" "Potla" "Italian_Plumbum" "Kynoe" "Hakamora" "Xelane" "BruhMoment" "Meet" "_Cyan" "dard"
<track "WoozyDuchess" "KaeKayyy" "Napoli" "neil123" "TahaUwU" "KO_O" "Juggernaut" "viv1kk" "potatos to die" "Ashwin"
<track "[-Wardran-]" "Calixniisama" "BlueRo" "Dygerz" "Logia" "Speshimen" "Retsu" "_Freezing_" "AaronA" "Pr0fan1ty"
<track "Unknown_KW" "F3Mantle" "Cips" "nitr0f" "Mr Secular" "Rentaku" "_amy" "Xav" "Aeroal" "PrinceCuber"
<track "DreKade" "armor039" "llyyr" "HadesYT" "sanjuBSK" "naoey" "nevetah" "Godlord110903" "SSingha" "_Rameez"
```
you can use <tracklist to check the current tracklist
